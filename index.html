                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Bagoole Ivan</strong>, and I was born in <strong>Kampala</strong>, the vibrant capital city of Uganda. I am a 30-year-old student currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Applied Technology</strong> at <strong>BYU-Idaho</strong>. I am passionate about technology and its potential to positively impact the world. My goal is to harness technology in ways that not only benefit others but also help them grow spiritually and personally, drawing closer to Christ.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my studies, I have a variety of personal interests. I have a deep love for <strong>soccer</strong> and enjoy playing and following the sport. Music is also a significant part of my life, and I especially enjoy singing. Whether it's traveling to new places or seeking out new adventures, I am always eager to explore the world around me.</p>
                    <p>Despite my love for adventure, I am a <strong>soft-spoken individual</strong> who finds peace in quiet, reflective spaces. I value the time I spend pondering and meditating, which allows me to find clarity and strength for both my academic and personal pursuits.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me!</p>
